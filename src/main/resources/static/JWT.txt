The diagram `jwt.png` depicts the working nature of JWD

By Seeing the jwt.img we can explain as below

    1] first client will send credentials to the server
    2] Server will validate the Credentials and `Create` and `Signs` the token
    3] Send token  back to the client
    4] In the subsequent request client can send only token to the server




 JWT token has 3 parts
    1st one will indicates the Algorithm and token type
    2nd one indicates that payload data
    3rd one indicates the signature

   Note->  all these parts will be separated by dot(.)
